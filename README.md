## Mission:
This is result of Stephen Grider's training that is hosted on Udemy.com. First commit in this repo stems from my 'starting block' (https://github.com/EnergeticPixels/boilerplate).

## Development Methodology:
* Mocha 90 percent of the way for interactions with MongoDB and Mongoose ODM.

## Accolades
- Stephen Grider. (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb/learn/v4/overview)


### Node Technologies:
- NODE: version 8 or above.  NPM: version 6 or above.
- Babel: Transpiling advanced javascript code. At this point, taking care of the 'imports' and 'exports default' statement
- Mocha

###  TODOs
- None assigned yet.

## Quick Start ##
If you're new to Node.js, these steps will get you started. Advanced users may want to look at the start-node.bat script and configure it for their environment. *nix shell scripts are also included, run `chmod 755 *.sh` if needed.

1. Download/clone this project
2. [Install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).
